title: "Website with Blogdown in R"

<br/>
  
**Skills Utilized**

* *Research*: I studied tutorials online and the Blogdown documentation to learn
the basics of creating a Blogdown website and then publishing it through Github.
* *Try, fail, and update*: I believe that this is *the* most important skill for
any programmer/data analyst. There are a lot of amazing help resources online. 
With a mix of persistence, curiousity, and problem-solving skills, a savvy coder
can get the job done as needed. 
* *R Markdown*: I learned how to use R markdown, a way to ensure that R code 
displays nicely in a browser.
* *Github*: I am hosting this portfolio from 
<a href='https://github.com/emilyhazelton' target='blank'>my Github profile</a>. 
I have experience tracking code updates through Github on my local computer and 
then publishing changes to my web account.
