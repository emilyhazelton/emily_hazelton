<h2>The Data Set</h2>
<p>This report explores loan data provided by the online lender Prosper.The data spans from November, 2005 to March, 2014, with 113,937 observations.</p>
<p>The data used in this exploration was tidied and provided by Udacity for the EDA learning section of their online Data Analysis degree. The original set included 81 variables, and my instructions were to evaluate 10-15 variables for my EDA. I chose the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loan amount</li>
<li>Loan term months</li>
<li>Loan status current</li>
<li>Employment status</li>
<li>Credit score lower</li>
<li>Credit score upper</li>
<li>Debt income ratio</li>
<li>Stated income monthly</li>
<li>Principal paid</li>
<li>Interest and fees paid</li>
<li>Estimated return</li>
</ul>
<p>I follow a standard EDA process in this project, progressing from <a href="#univariate">univariate</a> to <a href="#bivariate">bivariate</a> to <a href="#multivariate">multivariate</a> explorations. In the <a href="#summary">summary</a> section, I pick three visualizations from the EDA. These graphs are what I would communicate to stakeholders to share what I learned during my exploration.</p>
</div>
<div id="univariate" class="section level1">
<h1>Univariate Exploration</h1>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<p>Loan amounts cluster vary, with many loans equal to or less than $10,000. The most frequent loan amounts are $4,000, $15,000, $10,000, and $5,000.</p>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The loan terms in this data set fall into three bins: 12, 36, or 60 months, with 36 months being the most common. Since there are only 3 discrete values, I am going to change the vector type from integer to a factor, so I can graph it categorically in the bivariate section. I would also find the length-of-loan variable easier to interpret as 1, 3, or 5 years.</p>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It looks like borrowers’ credit scores are normally distributed, with the peak in the 685-695 bin.</p>

<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It looks like the most commonly occurring loan statuses are current, completed, and charged off. A charged off loan is one where the borrower defaulted and any remaining loan balance will likely not be collected.</p>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Monthly income appears to be normally distributed around a peak of about $3,000, with a long tail out into higher values.</p>

<p>The following graph shows lender_profit_current for only Completed or Chargedoff loans. It looks like closed loans are more scewed to positive profit for the bank than all loans (open and closed). This makes sense.</p>

<p>Mean bank profit on closed loans: Average profit of $21.12 seems low to me.</p>

<p>*** Making switch to check out just closed loans – look at historical trends pleted loans are loans where the borrower completely paid off the original loan amount. 24.0 percent of closed loans are in the Chargedoff category.</p>

<div id="bivariate-analysis---charged-off-and-completed-loans-only" class="section level3">
<h3>Bivariate Analysis - Charged Off and Completed Loans Only</h3>
<p>The spread for closed loans leans more towards smaller loans than the full Prosper set. Perhaps consumers were asking for smaller loans historically, or perhaps Prosper was more conservative in how much funding they would award to consumers as they refined their profit predictions – I don’t have a way to find the answer to that question with the dataset that I have.</p>
<p>Most popular loans: $4,000, $5,000, $3,000, $2,000</p>
<p>With these smaller loan sizes, this smaller profit makes more sense. This data was also collected over the span of the recession, so interest rates would have been very low during that time. That also helps explain the low ROI per loan.</p>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Three-year loans are still the most common. In relation to the 3-year loans, there are proportionally more 1-year loans and less 5-year loans as compared to the full Prosper loan dataset.</p>

<p>This graph shows what the bank estimated the return to be when they funded the loan. It looks like there is a spread between 0.025 and 0.2 (or 2.5 to 20 percent of return on investment).</p>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Most loans are profitable for the bank, with more common profits ranging from just breaking even (.0) to 50 percent (.5). There is a strange peak above 0.5, and I’m not sure why that is. If I were working for Prosper, I would definitely look at that. But for the sake of this project, I’m going to move past it.</p>
<p>The formula I used for acual return was lender_profit_current divided by loan_amount.</p>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>And zoomed in to remove that outlier column:</p>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 390 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).</code></pre>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The graph peaks at the 0.125-0.175 bin (or 12.5 to 17.5 percent debt-to-income ratio).</p>
<p>Did some transformations. Now, I have the following variables to move into the bivariate analysis:</p>
<pre><code>## [1] 50066    13</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] &quot;loan_status_current&quot;       &quot;loan_term_years&quot;

<h2>Bivariate Exploration</h2>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<p>Let’s start by looking at the correlations between different variables.</p>
<pre><code>## Warning in ggcorr(closed_loans, label = TRUE): data in column(s)
## &#39;loan_status_current&#39;, &#39;loan_term_years&#39;, &#39;employment_status&#39; are not
## numeric and were ignored</code></pre>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It looks like there may be a negative correlation between annual income and estimated return. My primary factor of interest is estimated_return (displayed across the bottom). Some of the strong correlations – between principal paid and loan_amount or actual_return and lender_profit_current – are obvious because the variables do have an explicit relationship.</p>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 539 rows containing missing values (geom_point).</code></pre>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/Bivariate_Plots-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It doesn’t look like I will be able to use credit score in a predictive model for actual return. I really expected more of a correlation. It does look like individuals who have a score over 800 are a very safe bet for investment. Perhaps the overplotting on this graph is hiding a trend that is there.</p>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 464 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot).</code></pre>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It looks like the median return is above 0 for all ranges except those centering at 450 and below. And the peak in the median return occurs at a credit score of 570.</p>
<p>With this graph, it looks like there is a pattern in the relationship between credit score and return. Those with poor or fair credit scores are bringing the highest rate of return. This is likely because these individuals pay higher interest rates.</p>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It looks like three-year loans have the highest median percentage of return. And it looks like Prosper is losing the most money on five-year loans. In fact, almost half of five-year loans are losing money.</p>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Here we see the effects of overplotting within the bands of most common loan amounts. It does look like the return falls much more above 0, which is good for Prosper. Let’s take a look at this with a boxplot grouping to see where the medians lie by $1,000 bins.</p>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 17 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot).</code></pre>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Return is above 0 for all loan amounts. There really is no evidence of variation in the loan amount changing the ROI.</p>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 3975 rows containing missing values (geom_point).</code></pre>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The relationship between bank profit and stated monthly income doesn’t seem to have a linear pattern, but an outlier is seriously skewing the x scale of that graph, so I’m going to zoom in.</p>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 3975 rows containing missing values (geom_point).</code></pre>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It seems as though a higher debt_income_ratio (DIR) is related to a higher profit. There seem to be some tiers to the data, althought it is still hard to see due to overplotting. But it seems that there are jumps in the level of profit at both 0.25 and 0.5 marks for DIR.</p>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>These are some strange tiers, with redundancy. My guess is that the option set changed at some point in data collection. For example “employed” was later changed to two options – “part-time” and “full-time.”</p>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The plot shows density, so that the count of each category doesn’t scew the graph. The graph shows a proportion for each category.</p>
<p>It is surprising to me that those with an employment_status of ‘employed’ bring Prosper a lower actual_return. However, I know that some of the data collection criteria changed in 2009, based on the data dictionary. I don’t know exactly when the employment_status optionset would have changed. But if ‘Employed’ is from an earlier date, it’s not a good comparison (because there are many environmental differences that could make a difference if the data was collected during two different time periods).</p>
<p>Let’s zoom in to the peak area of this graph.</p>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 11333 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 12 rows containing missing values (geom_path).</code></pre>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It’s interesting that retired and part-time individuals seem to peak at a higher actual_return rate. Perhaps it is a similar phenomenon to why Prosper makes a better return for those with lower credit scores – perhaps these individuals are assigned a higher interest rate.</p>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 5884 rows containing missing values (geom_point).</code></pre>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png" width="672" /></p>

<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It looks like debt-to-income ratio is higher in the middle regions of the credit score range. I believe that debt to income ratio is one factor that influences credit score, so it makes sense that those with an excellent credit score would have a low debt to income ratio. I wonder if those with a score under 530 simply have a harder time getting a loan and therefore don’t have as much debt.</p>

<h3>Bivariate Summary</h3>
<p>Loan term covaried with actual return. The return for one-year loans was mostly positive, but not much more than 0. Three-year loans brought in the highest return. Five-year loans were responsible for the most lost in return.</p>
<p>Credit score also varied with actual return. Credit scores centering right under 600 actually brought the highest level of return.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I really didn’t find any other patterns of covariation.</p>

</ul>
<p><img src="projects-prosper_files/figure-html/Multivariate_Plots-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Within loans that are three years in duration (the most commonly occurring and easiest to see), it looks like the median return is highest in the upper 500s and lower 600s. The median return steadily increases above a credit score of 630.</p>

<p>Prosper gives out loans that are one, three, or five years in duration. Almost 90 percent of loans are provided with a three year term. The median return for these loans is 13.6 percent. However, the average return is only 4 percent. Negative outliers are bringing the average lower than the median.</p>
<p>The median return for one-year loans is 5.9 percent, with average profit at 3.8 percent. And the median return for five-year loans is 5.8 percent, with average profit at negative 13.4 percent. As can be seen in the graph above, the second quartile for five-year loans falls into a negative return. The five-year loan category is not profitable for Prosper.</p>

<p>This graph shows that the median profit is above 0 for almost all credit score categories except those below 470. However, if we look at the mean profit, return becomes reliable above a credit score of 530.</p>

<h3>Further areas for investigation:</h3>
<ul>
<li>How does early payoff impact actual return? That is, if a borrower pays their loan off early, I anticipate that actual return would be lower.<br />
</li>
<li>Analyze the difference between estimated return and actual return. Focus on areas where the bank anticipated profit but lost money. Is there a factor that their predictions should also take into account? Or is that just part of the risk of the lending process (e.g. the exploration would not uncover additional factors to create better predictive models of expected profit)?</li>
